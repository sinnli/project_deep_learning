# project_deep_learning
Learning the field of Machine Learning, dived deeper into the subsubject deep learning.
## Stochastic Gradient Descent
In the first assignment the priciples of overfitting and underfitting are ×§emphasized.
The implementation of stochastic gradient descent which is later responsible to update 
the weights in a Neural Network was done. This function is fully implemented in the pyTorch 
libarary which is used in the other assingments.
## Word Prediction
Implementaion of a NN that predicts the next work in a sentece. In order to do so the words 
where represented as vectors and onehot vectors as labels.
## Image Classification
A CNN model was build that matches shoe images; the left shoe to the right pair shoe.
## Variational Autoencoders
Building a modele that produces new human faces with variational autoencoders (VAEs).
Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality 
reduction. They aim to encode input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then decode
it back to its original form. The architecture consists of an encoder, which compresses the input
data into a hidden representation, and a decoder, which reconstructs the original data from the 
compressed representation.
## Instrument Recognition
In the project models that recognize the instruments playing in a classical piece of music are build.
Once in the time domain and another approch is done in the frequency domain.
The data trained with was taken from a Kaggle resource.
